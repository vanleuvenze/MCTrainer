A quiz on a selection of Wine and Beer made in California.
Made to help familiarize myself with the products sold in the
Cheese/Wine/Beer shop in which I was working at the time.

The selection of wine and beer is specific to the shop that I was working
in, and each style of wine is reffering to one specific wine that was in stock.
For example:  The quiz will prompt 'Pinot Noir' and the following questions refer to
a single Pinot Noir from California that the shop had in Stock at that time. 

So the context of the quiz is a bit strange for anyone other than me... 

But if you are interested in seeing how it works, please check it out!
this is more of a demonstration  (and practice for myself) than anything else.

After you begin the quiz, open your console and you should see an array containing the
answers.  Use this to get through the quiz so that you can see how everything works, and 
how the quiz develops.

Thanks!
